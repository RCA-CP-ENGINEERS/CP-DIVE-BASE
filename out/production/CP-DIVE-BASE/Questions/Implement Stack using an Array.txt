Implement a stack with the following operations:
push(x): Pushes an element onto the stack.
pop(): Removes the top element from the stack.
top(): Returns the top element.
empty(): Returns whether the stack is empty.
Example:

Copy code
Input:
["MyStack","push","push","top","pop","empty"]
[[],[1],[2],[],[],[]]

Output:
[null,null,null,2,2,false]
